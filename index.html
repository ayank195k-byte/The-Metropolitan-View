        <h1 class="headline">When Do You Become an Adult?</h1>
        <p class="deck">
          Legal age is simple. Real adulthood isn’t. In a world of debt, delayed milestones, and uneven support systems,
          “adult” has become less of a birthday and more of a burden—distributed unequally.

            Modern adulthood isn’t a single milestone—it's a moving target shaped by economics, family, and support.

          <span class="dropcap">A</span>dulthood used to be measured like a checklist: move out, get a job, get married,
          buy a home. Now, those milestones are delayed or unreachable for a lot of people—and “adult” becomes more
          psychological than practical. In that gap, people feel grown on paper but lost in real life.
        </p>

        <p>
          If adulthood is responsibility, then the question isn’t “How old are you?” It’s “What are you expected to carry?”
          The problem is that expectations aren’t equal. Some people inherit stability; others inherit obstacles.

        <p>
          This piece sits inside a familiar post-graduation fog: people who are technically qualified but emotionally unready,
          expected to “know the plan” immediately. The article points to something basic but often missing—honest conversations
          between parents and young adults about goals, fear, and what “independence” actually means.
        </p>

        <p>
          The limitation is time: 2008 is a different economy. Still, it captures a truth that didn’t expire—many young adults
          feel like they’re performing adulthood rather than living it.

          This reporting highlights the unfair version of adulthood: turning 18 or 21 and being expected to survive with minimal
          support. When foster youth age out, adulthood can look like immediate housing insecurity—more cliff than milestone.
        </p>

        <p>
          If middle-class kids can lean on family well into their twenties, why do vulnerable young adults get treated like
          “full adults” the moment the system is done with them?

        </figure>

        <p>
          These pieces push the definition away from traditional milestones and toward capability: taking care of yourself,
          owning your choices, and managing consequences. That definition is cleaner—but it can hide how economics shapes
          “capability.” Responsibility is easier to carry when the ground under you is stable.
        </p>

        <h2>So, when do you become an adult?</h2>
        <p>
          You become an adult when responsibility becomes real—when choices have weight and you’re accountable for the outcome.
          But the harsh truth is that the timing isn’t equal. For some, adulthood is gradual; for others, it’s forced.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we want a society that doesn’t confuse survival with maturity, we need to stop treating “adult” like a label and
          start treating it like a condition we either support—or abandon.
        </p>
